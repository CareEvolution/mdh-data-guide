# Transform and Analyze Fitbit Data

| Tutorial | Description 
| --- | --- |
|[Fitbit Wear Patterns](https://github.com/CareEvolution/mdh-data-guide/blob/main/notebooks/transform_analyze_fitbit_data/fitbit_wear_patterns.ipynb)|Construct a simple model to determine if a participant "wore their fitbit today" (defined in this example as "complete intraday step data is available for 12 full hours") and visualize the result over time.|
|[Resting Heart Rate Algorithm Comparison](https://github.com/CareEvolution/mdh-data-guide/blob/main/notebooks/transform_analyze_fitbit_data/rhr_algorithm_comparison.ipynb)|Construct three simple models that calculate "resting heart rate" using Fitbit intraday data and compare to the native Fitbit daily RHR metric.|
